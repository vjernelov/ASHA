This archetype consists of all 50 elements in the full EPIC questionnaire, and can be adjusted to the EPIC Short Form (EPIC-26) in a template. See also the example template in the archetypes Resource Centre in the CKM.

Even though the numbering of  the questions differs between the full edition and the short form, they share the same unique 'Item number', which can be found in each elements 'Annotation' in a Key attribute named 'Item_number'. Also added in Annotations is information about to which domain and subscale each question belongs to, in order to help implementers to extract data to further analysis. In addition each element also has identified in Annotation which number each question appears in, in the paper form. The full list of Annotations is as follows:

- Key \"Item_number\"identifies the unique and common 'Item number' from the questionnaires in their original publication.
- Key \"Domain\" identifies which domain each question belongs to: 'Urinary', 'Bowel', 'Sexual' or 'Hormonal'.
- Key \"Subscale\"  identifies which subscale each question adheres to, either 'Function' or 'Bother', and is named in the format <Domain name + Subscale>.
- Key \"Subscale2\" identifies which subscale the urinary domain questions belongs to, either 'Incontinence' or 'Irritative/Obstructive'.
- Key \"Full_number\" identifies the number the question has in the original full Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite.
- Key \"Short_form\" identifies the number the question has in the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composit Short Form (EPIC-26) version.

The keys 'Domain', 'Subscale' and 'Subscale2' in Annotations allows consumers of data from this archetype to orchestrate the data for further analysis, especially to perform scoring as described in \"Scoring Instructions for the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite\" and  \"Scoring Instructions for the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite Short Form\".

Each element has a descriptive name, not documented in the validated score, in order to shorten the path. The wording of each original question in documented 'Description', and this is the text that should be displayed to users in an application.">
