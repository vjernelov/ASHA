Use a separate instance of this archetype to record the conclusion for each suspected 'Index disease'. For example in a fever & rash investigation, considering Measles and Rubella as the potential causes, use one instance of this archetype to record the conclusion, rationale, evidence etc related to Measles, and another to carry the information related to Rubella.">
