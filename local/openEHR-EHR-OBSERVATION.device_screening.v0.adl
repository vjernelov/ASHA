Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Screening for implanted devices before an MRI test.
- Checklist questions about whether the individual uses any assistive devices on admission to hospital.

The initial question about any medical device use is focused on implanted devices due to the clinical safety implications, especially when undergoing imaging examinations.

Examples of implanted medical devices include, but are not limited to:
- cochlear implant; 
- pacemaker; 
- aneurysm clips;
- joint replacement; 
- heart valve; 
- coronary stent; 
- bone fixation device eg screws or plates; 
- deep brain stimulator; or
- intraocular lens.

Examples of assistive aids include, but are not limited to:
- wheelchair; 
- walking stick; 
- hearing aid; 
- reading glasses; 
- prosthetic limb; 
- braille reader; 
- speech generating device; or 
- medication organiser or dispenser.

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.

The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to a point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of the EVENT structure to distinguish between a questions related to different timeframes, such as 'ever', 'now' and in a specified interval of time - for example, the difference between \"Have you ever used a hearing aid?\", \"Do you currently use a hearing aid?\" and \"Have you used a hearing aid in the past year?\"

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence or usage of a medical device, it is recommended that the clinical system record and persist the specific details about the device using EVALUATION.device_summary.

The specific and intended semantics can be further clarified in a template. For example: the actual date and/or time; the dates when the implant was inserted or removed; the interval of time during which the implant was inserted; the implant duration; the age of the individual at the time the implant was inserted; or the duration of time since it was inserted or removed. A partial date is valid, using the DV_DATE_TIME data type, to record only a year. (en)">
